# Filia
Mental Health is not a destination but a process. It's about how you drive not where you are going.

## Why Filia?

Mental Health is the emotional well-being of an individual, however, people in the LGBTQ community experience mental health issues at higher rates.
A recent study found that 61% have depression
45% have PTSD
36% have an anxiety disorder. 
40 percent of transgender individuals have attempted suicide in their lifetime.

Keeping this in mind we decided to make a platform Inclusive of everyone where one can check their mental health, contact therapists, Read jokes and play games to lift their mood, in addition, we have also integrated a Chatbot!

## How we made it
We designed the UI of our Website on Figma and prototyped it to see the user flow.
We made our own Machine Learning model using Data Science Concepts to determine if one's Mental Health is poor or not. Next, we made a Chatbot for individuals to ask questions about mental health. The Frontend of website is written using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and the Backend uses NodeJS, ExpressJS, and EJS. We then integrated the ML model and chatbot as well. We deployed this all on heroku.
In the website we've included a Jokes API,therapists' info as well as Games.
